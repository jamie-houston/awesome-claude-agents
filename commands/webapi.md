# Create API Endpoints

Implement Web API controller(s) and DTOs based on the PRD.

## Your Task

1. Create request/response DTOs in Models/ (use records)
2. Add validation attributes to request DTOs
3. Create controller in Controllers/
4. Implement CRUD endpoints (or as specified in PRD)
5. Use proper HTTP status codes (201, 204, 400, 404)
6. Verify `dotnet build` succeeds
7. Commit: "feat: add [Resource] API endpoints"

## IMPORTANT

After creating endpoints:
1. List the endpoints created (method, path, description)
2. Show the DTOs created
3. Confirm build succeeded
4. **STOP and wait for user review**
5. Tell user: "API endpoints complete. When ready, run `/test` to add tests"

Do NOT proceed to testing automatically.
