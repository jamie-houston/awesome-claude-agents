Start the interview orchestration workflow.

Use the Orchestrator agent defined in `.claude/agents/universal/orchestrate.md` to:
1. Track the 2-hour timeline
2. Guide through each phase (PRD → Scaffold → Data → API → Tests → Polish)
3. Provide time warnings (1:00, 0:30, 0:15 remaining)
4. Remind to commit after each logical chunk
5. Help prioritize when stuck

Current phase or question: $ARGUMENTS

If starting fresh, begin with requirements gathering.
